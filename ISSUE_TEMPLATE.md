# Issue Template

## Notes

> Before opening a new issue, search the issue tracker because chances are someone has already posted something similar. Try different but similar keywords in your search as well.

In almost all of the bug reporting cases, you can set up a repository reproducing the bug. This should give us all the information we need to know in order to identify the bug and fix it. Just copy-pasting a few lines of code is not a good way to help us reproduce a bug.

> Bug reports that cannot be reproduced, due to lack of a sample, will be labeled as `not-reproducible and closed immediately. Such issues could be reopened once the user edits the issue post and provides the sample repo.

After posting the issue, if more information is required, we will ask you so be available and check the issue you created after a while.

> Inactive issues will be labeled as `inactive` and immediately closed. However, they could be reopened as more information is available.
